Repository for the Interactive Detector online game

Starting upload to github with the game at stage where random base 5 number is generated and user inputs answer with buttons.

6/4: In this update the game should be easy to integrate the tracks into. The game file no longer uses the React library, which was unneccesarily complicated, the display now also uses a whole detector instead of the quarter segement. At this point there is still the same game of show a random base 5 answer with button inputs but some files have been renamed and it's been restructured - so easy comparison may not be possible.
