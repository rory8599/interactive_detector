                    Welcome to the Particle Identifier! A game that puts you in the control room of one of CERN’s particle physics experiments. 
                    
                    A series of particle tracks will appear on our detector display and we need you to identify what they are.

                    Particle physics is based on something called the Standard Model; it describes all the particles we know about. 
                    Physicists around the world are testing the limits of this model as well as searching for anything that might be missing from it with all sorts of experiments.

                    Many of these experiments are based at CERN, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider - the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. 
                    <br>
                    Here, particles are accelerated to almost the speed of the light, and then they’re collided at one of the detectors creating a huge burst of energy and a vast number of particles - some of which have never been seen before! 
                    <br><br>
                    Many of the particles created are  very unstable and will decay within a fraction of a second into one of 5 types that scientists can detect.

                <p class="tabText">
                    The CERN experiments can detect and track 5 types of particles. These are: photons, electrons, muons, neutral hadrons, charged hadrons. 
                    The important thing is they all have different properties (such as mass, electric charge etc.) which means they behave differently in our detector - this is how physicists, <span style="font-style: italic; display: inline;">and you</span> will tell them apart. 
                    <br>
                    In the next steps, we'll quickly see each section of the detector and the particles it can detect. If you want to find out more about how they work and were made, check out the Info panel which has links where you can find out more!

                <h3 class = "tabHeader">Subdetector: Silicon Tracker</h3>
                <p class="tabText">
                    The Silicon tracker is the first part of the detector that all our particles travel through – it tells us where a particle has been which can be used to calculate the momentum of some particles - this is very handy for our physicists, but we don't need to worry about that for now.

                <h3 class = "tabHeader">Subdetector: ECAL</h3>
                <p class="tabText">
                    The Electromagnetic Calorimeter is used to detect electrons and photons. When they pass through this section, they are stopped and produce a flash of light and we can measure the energy. 
                    <br><br>
                    If a track stops here, it is an either an electron or photon. Curved tracks are from electrically charged particles - electrons have an electric charge and photons are neutral.

                <h3 class = "tabHeader">Subdetector: HCAL</h3>
                <p class="tabText">
                    The Hadron Calorimeter is used to detect the neutral hadrons and charged hadrons. A hadron is just any particle made up of quarks (see the Standard Model), these include protons and neutrons which make up all the atoms in our body and pretty much everything around us. 
                    <br><br>
                    When they go through this section they’re stopped, any track that stops here will be a hadron, and we can tell if it's charged or neutral based on whether it's a curved or straight path.

                <h3 class = "tabHeader">Magnet</h3>
                <p class="tabText">
                    The magnet is extremely important for a particle detector; we can use it to alter the movemement of charged particles. 
                    Charged particles (such as the electron, muon, and charged hadron) will travel in a curved path because of the magnet, neutral particles (such as the photon and neutral hadron) will continue in a straight line unaffected. This is key to telling particles apart if they stop in the same part of the detector.

                <p class="tabText">
                    Finally, there’s the muon tracker. The 4 other types of particle have all been stopped, but the muon plows through, the tracker at the outer edge should only pick up muons. 
                    <br><br>
                    The muon creates a distinctive S-shaped track because once it passes through to the other side of the magnet the magnetic field points in the opposite direction – which makes it curve the other way.

                                This is the electromagnetic calorimeter; it is also known as a scintillator. This means when particles like electrons or photons go through it, they create a flash of light. We can measure this light and from that calculate the energy of the photons and electrons.

                                The hadron calorimeter measures the energy of hadrons – these are particles that are made of quarks (like protons or neutrons). The hadrons will go into a thick absorber layer so the hadrons break down into particles that can be detected by a scintillator layer, just like in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

                                Magnets are incredibly important in particle detectors; they can control the path of charged particles. This is a very large solenoid magnet which makes a magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than the Earth’s!

                                Muons are like electrons but a lot heavier, so they aren’t stopped by the calorimeters. The final part of the detector is designed just to detect muons. The muon trackers show us where the muons have been, then based on how curved the path is we can find the momentum.
